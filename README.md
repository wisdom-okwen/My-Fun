# My-Fun

***My Fun App*** is a web application under development. It's the one-stop-app for you to track and share all your fun activities including trips, hikes, hangouts and more. Unlike other social media platforms that are saturated with many different things, ***My Fun App*** is tailored purposely for fun activities you've done in the past.

### Why Is This necessary?

You've probably been in a situation where you planned to travel to places and do some fun stuff. However, you had to do a random Google search to find good places to visit at your destination. Google is a good algorithm and actually gives you great pictures of the places, but how about you see how real people felt when they visited those places? With ***My Fun***, you'll get to appreciate through the lens of others' experiences how it feels like to be there. The end goal? You might want to visit if people enjoyed the place or remove the place from your bucket list if it was a terrible experience for others.
