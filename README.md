# My-Fun

***My Fun App*** is an AI-integrated web application under development. It's the one-stop-app for you to track and share all your fun activities including trips, hikes, hangouts and more. Unlike other social media platforms that are saturated with many different things, ***My Fun App*** is tailored purposely for fun activities you've done in the past, currently doing or plan to do in the future.

### Why Is This necessary?

You've probably been in a situation where you planned to travel to places and do some fun stuff. However, you had to do a random Google search to find good places to visit at your destination. Google is a good algorithm and actually gives you great pictures of the places, but how about you see how real people felt when they visited those places? 
With ***My Fun***, you'll get to appreciate through the lens of others' experiences how it feels like to be there. The end goal? You might want to visit if people enjoyed the place or remove the place from your bucket list if it was a terrible experience for others. 
Let's consider another scenario: You just joined your new team in a new city and you're having a conversation with them about exciting places you can visit. They then start to throw so many places at you and what they recommend doing/how they recommend going there based on their experience. All you could do was to write down the names of `some` of the places you could remember. You're losing so much information. ***MyFun*** gives you the opportunity to pull up those places with images and other info and confirm with the team (that may even lead to better conversations) after which you can add it to your backlist, still within My Fun. There, you could also add some short notes about all the recommendations and things to be aware of regarding the places before making a decision.
That's not all... not that quick! With ***My Fun*** you'll have the opportunity to create your own experience, get expert recommendations (available when AI is integrated) on future activities as well as create your own bucket list (whether based on recommendations from people or by your own search).

**Welcome To My Fun! I'm having fun developing this. Please have fun using it.**
